# AppMan
Application Management UI

This is a Local Java Application designed to monitor, create, and manage multiple types of Applications 
and Infrastructure from one user friendly portal.

## First Time Setup:
1. If not already installed on your machine, download and install [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).
2. Navigate to the [Releases Tab](https://github.com/aikoels/appman/releases) on the project's Github. 
3. On the top-most release, click on `Source Code.zip` under the assets.
4. Expand `Source Code.zip` and navigate to the folder.
5. Double click on either `windows-build.bat` or `mac-build.bat` depending on your operating system. 
6. After the script is complete running double click the `.jar` file in the source code directory.

## Briefing
“This application is tailored to developers who want to create or maintain their application. 
The application allows you to simultaneously create your application and visualize a tech stack 
by assembling “lego” pieces in your workbench. You can move the “LEGOs” from your toolbox to workbench 
to create new infrastructure or applications. Each “lego” is a different technology which, when assembled, 
create a full tech stack. You can also manage previously created applications, servers, 
and virtual machines as well as see different statistics about them. 
There are two types of people who will use our application; someone who is constantly making projects 
and wants to easily create and maintain their application and then someone who has a business 
and wants to do the same thing. We will give you 3 tasks and your job is to try 
and complete them all. You can complete these tasks in any order. Got it?”

### MVP
A local interface which simulates the functionality of appman.

## Class Notes
This was built for IS4300 at Northeastern University for the Fall 2019 semester. 

## Using AppMan
Talk about the lego metaphor.
